# Module 5 Challenge - PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. V. Isualize is the CEO of the company, and wants a comprehensive summary of the ride-sharing data by city type.
This report should have the total weekly fares for each city type. It should also have a visual representation of the total fare per city of a weekly basis.
This analysis and the conclusions of this report would be used by decision-makers in PyBer. 


### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze and create the required report for the CEO of PyBer.
This report should contain:
1. A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
3. A written report for the PyBer analysis. This report should contain the three business recommendations to the CEO to address the disparities among the city types.

The city type wise analysis is as below:
1. Rural - The number of rides in rural is less when compared to suburban and urban. The rides to driver ratio is 125/78 which is 1.6. The number of drivers is less when compared to the rides, but the rides themselves are less in number. Also the Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver is higher than Suburban and Urban areas. 

2. Suburban - The number of rides in suburban is less when compared to urban but more than rural. The rides to driver ratio is 625/490 which is 1.28. The total fares is much more than rural but less than half of urban. Also the Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver is high.

3. Urban - The number of rides is highest among all the city types. The rides to driver ratio is 1625/2405 which is 0.68. The demand of rides is high and the Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver is the lowest among the three city types

These results are represented in the multiple-line chart as well

# PyBer Analysis Summary

The below recommendations can be derived from the PyBer analysis:

Urban - The total number of rides is the highest in this category, however the number of drivers is also large as is evident from the rides to driver ratio. It would be beneficial if the number of rides in this area can be increased, so that the ratio improves and the total fares can be increased. 

Suburban - It would be feasible to increase the number of rides in this category to improve the ride to driver ratio. This would drive up the total fares, and also provide a better average fare per ride and driver.

Rural - This category has the highest profit but the number of rides is very less. It would be beneficial if the number of rides in rural can be increased by providing some offers or some discounts to the customers as the profit margin is high in this category. The total rides need to increase and also the total drivers can be increased here.
